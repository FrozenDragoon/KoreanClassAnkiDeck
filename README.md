# Korean Class Anki Deck

**Download the latest deck on the [releases tab](/releases).**

This script will ultimate by used to take input from a CSV and automatically
(or as automatically as possible) pull audio files from ~~Naver dictionary,~~ Forvo, and Papago
(Naver) TTS.

These will then be combined into an Anki deck that can be shared.

2025-04-11 - I've begun adding native audio from Forvo.com. Files are pulled manually, and so are stored in this
repo.

## Importing Deck Updates

**Note**: The deck must remain at the top level (not nested within a deck "folder"). This is due to
"folders" being decks themselves and causing the ID/name of the imported deck to not match.

To import deck updates, simply open the `.apkg` file (either on Mobile or Desktop). Leave all the
options at their default:

- "Import Any Learning Progress": Unchecked
- "Import any deck presets": Unchecked

There may be times where different options will be required (as changes are made to the card format,
etc) but those times will be called out specifically on the releases page along with the new file.

In the event that a card is changed dramatically, the old (possibly incorrect) card will need to be
manually removed. I will also include instructions for that.
