# Korean Class Anki Deck

**Download the latest deck on the [releases tab](/releases).**

This script will ultimate by used to take input from a CSV and automatically
(or as automatically as possible) pull audio files from ~~Naver dictionary, Forvo, and~~ Papago
(Naver) TTS.

These will then be combined into an Anki deck that can be shared.

As of 2025-04-02 all text is generated using Papago TTS (using the NaverTTS package). Pulling native
audio from Naver's KoEng Dictionary and Forvo is a work in progress.

## Importing Deck Updates

To import deck updates, simply open the `.apkg` file (either on Mobile or Desktop). Leave all the
options at their default:

- "Import Any Learning Progress": Unchecked
- "Import any deck presets": Unchecked

There may be times where different options will be required (as changes are made to the card format,
etc) but those times will be called out specifically on the releases page along with the new file.
